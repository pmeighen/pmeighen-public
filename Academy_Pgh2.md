To whom it may concern;

Hello !

I am writing to you in conjunction with my application to the Academy Pittsburgh coding boot-camp. 
   
Prior to writing code I spent fourteen years working as a mortgage loan officer. A product I found to be very complex is commonly refereed to as a 'renovation loan'.  A renovation loan program allows an individual (or individuals) to borrow money to purchase a home and, in addition, funds to renovate the home and/or property.  

Loan officers typically will not offer a renovation loan product because, much like writing code, a renovationation loan product is perceinved be cumbersome and so technically difficult that it cannot be mastered with a reasonable effort.  Again, much like writing code, it really isn't all that difficult when tasks are separated into pieces and those pieces are handled one at a time with the overall framework in mind.   


The diferentiating factors that seperatae a traditional mortgage from a renovationon mortgage are as followws -

1 - The addition of a licensed contractor who will perform the actual renovation work according to pre-approved plans and specifications.
  
2 - The creation of a 'draw schedule' that defines how and when the phases of renovation work will be inspected and also the scheduling of subsequant disbursements.  

3 â€“ The final inspection and disbursement, issuance of the 
	Occupancy Permit, and Deed recording.

This a high level view of the renovation segment of the loan program.  Other than the renovation segment a renovation loan is a traditional home loan.

Becoming proficient with renovation lending was not only a lot of fun but also me to help a lot of families and individuals make an otherwise undesirable, and in some cases unlivable home livable.  Good for the homeowner, the neighborhood, school district and more.

Thank you very much for your consideration,

 - Pat
